# SlackBots
Collection of slack automation scripts. Edit them to suite your needs.

## Re-post + Re-pin Script
Script to re-post and re-pin pinned messages that are >=89 days old from every non-archived channel. This is to make sure pinned messages don't get lost in the free version of slack where messages older than 90 days are deleted.
